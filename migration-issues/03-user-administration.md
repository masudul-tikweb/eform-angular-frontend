# Sub-Issue: Migrate User Administration Tests to Cypress

## Priority
ðŸ”´ **HIGH** - Core user management functionality

## Description
Migrate User Administration wdio test to Cypress. This test covers managing user accounts and changing user names.

## Tests to Migrate

- [ ] `user-administration.name-change.spec.ts` - User name modification

## Current Location
- **wdio tests**: `eform-client/e2e/Tests/user-administration/`
- **Target location**: `eform-client/cypress/e2e/e/` (or appropriate grouping)

## Test Coverage Details

### user-administration.name-change.spec.ts
- Should navigate to user administration page
- Should edit user's name successfully
- Should validate name requirements
- Should save changes and verify update
- Should handle cancellation without saving
- Should display appropriate messages on success/failure

## Page Objects
- **Action**: Create Page Object for user administration in Cypress
- **Reference**: Check if user administration page object exists in wdio version

## Key Functionality to Test
1. Navigate to user administration page
2. Select/identify user to edit
3. Open edit dialog/form
4. Modify user name
5. Save changes
6. Verify name update in user list
7. Test cancellation scenario
8. Test validation rules (if any)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test file migrated to Cypress
- [ ] Tests follow existing Cypress patterns
- [ ] Page object created for user administration
- [ ] All user name change scenarios covered
- [ ] Success and error paths tested
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] Tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Test user properly cleaned up or reset

## Technical Notes
- Use `cy.intercept()` for user administration API calls
- Handle user selection/identification properly
- Ensure test doesn't modify real/important users
- Use test user accounts that can be safely modified
- Consider pagination if user list is large

## Dependencies
- Login functionality (already available in Cypress)
- User administration page navigation
- Test user account

## Estimated Effort
**Small** (1-2 hours) - Single test file with straightforward functionality
